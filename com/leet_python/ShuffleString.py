1528. Shuffle String

Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

Example 3:
Input: s = "aiohn", indices = [3,1,4,2,0]
Output: "nihao"

Example 4:
Input: s = "aaiougrt", indices = [4,0,2,6,7,3,1,5]
Output: "arigatou"

Example 5:
Input: s = "art", indices = [1,0,2]
Output: "rat"
 
Constraints:
s.length == indices.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
s contains only lower-case English letters.
0 <= indices[i] < n
All values of indices are unique (i.e. indices is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n - 1).
