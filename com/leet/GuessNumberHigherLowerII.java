//We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
//
//I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
//
//Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
//
//However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. 
//You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
//
//Example:
//
//n = 10, I pick 8.
//
//First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
//Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
//Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
//
//Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
//
//You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
//Given a particular n ยกร 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
//
//Hint:
//
//1. The best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could possibly face. 
//Another strategy is to minimize the expected loss. Here, we are interested in the first scenario.
//2. Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end up paying in the worst case?
//3. Check out this article if you're still stuck.
//4. The purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a small n. You MUST use dynamic programming.
//5. As a follow-up, how would you modify your code to solve the problem of minimizing the expected loss, 
//instead of the worst-case loss?
