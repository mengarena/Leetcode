Question:    

Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, 
keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.

For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+


==Answer:
//81%
1) delete from Person where Person.Id NOT IN (select IdSet.Id from (select A.Id from (select distinct Email, Id from Person order by Id asc) as A group by Email) as IdSet);
   
1.1) select distinct Email, Id from Person order by Id asc --> get Id in ASC order
1.2) select A.Id from (select distinct Email, Id from Person order by Id asc) as A group by Email --> Get Id for unique email
1.3) (select A.Id from (select distinct Email, Id from Person order by Id asc) as A group by Email) as IdSet  --> Form a table only containing the Id from 1.2)
1.4) select IdSet.Id from (select A.Id from (select distinct Email, Id from Person order by Id asc) as A group by Email) as IdSet  -->Get the Id list to limit the delete
(without this "distinct", result seems wrong)

//35%
2) delete p2 from Person p1, Person p2 where STRCMP(p1.Email, p2.Email) = 0 and p1.Id < p2.Id;

//81%
3) delete from Person where Person.Id NOT IN (select min_id from (select min(Id) as min_id from Person group by Email) as IdSet);
