Question: Consecutive Numbers

Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


== Answer:

1) select distinct log1.Num 
from Logs log1, Logs log2, Logs log3 where log1.Num = log2.Num and log2.Num = log3.Num and log2.Id - log1.Id = 1 and log3.Id - log2.Id = 1;

* Solution 1) is based on an assumption that the Id are consecutive.



2) This solution does not assume that the Id are consecutive.

select distinct Num from 
(select Num, 
         case 
             when @record = Num then @count := @count + 1
             when @record <> @record := Num then @count := 1
         end as Cnt
   from Logs, (select @count := 0, @record := (select Num from Logs limit 0,1)) as NumCount
) as stat
where stat.Cnt >= 3;

OR:

select distinct Num from 
(select Num, 
         case 
             when @record = Num then @count := @count + 1
             when (@record := Num) IS NOT NULL then @count := 1       <---- Difference in this line
         end as Cnt
   from Logs, (select @count := 0, @record := (select Num from Logs limit 1)) as NumCount
) as stat
where stat.Cnt >= 3;



**Analysis for Solution 2):

2.1) Simplify it to:  select distinct Num from stat where stat.cnt >= 3    (in stat, there are Num and Cnt two columns)

2.2) stat =
   select Num, 
         case 
             when @record = Num then @count := @count + 1
             when @record <> @record := Num then @count := 1
         end as Cnt
   from Logs, (select @count := 0, @record := (select Num from Logs limit 0,1)) as NumCount 
   
   This part calculate count for Nums in Logs,
   it generate something like:
   *Num*    *Count*
    2          1
    1          1
    1          2
    1          3
    2          1
    3          1
    3          2
    3          3
    3          4
    ....
    
2.2.1) Simplify 2.2) to select Num, Cnt from Logs, NumCount

2.2.2) NumCount = { select @count := 0, @record := (select Num from Logs limit 0,1)  }   --- It is actually initializing @count and @record
       * Here limit 0, 1 could also be written as limit 1 
       
2.2.3) select Num from Logs limit 0,1 --> select the Num of the first record in Logs table (limit 0, 1 means start from offset 0 and 1 record)

2.2.4) Cnt = 
         case 
             when @record = Num then @count := @count + 1
             when @record <> @record := Num then @count := 1
         end
      This part calcualte count for each Num
