Question: Nth Highest Salary

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. 
If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

==Answer:

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  set N = N-1;   <---Add by me
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select distinct Salary from Employee order by Salary DESC limit N,1     <-- Add by me
  );
END


Attention:

Can't write like:  select distinct Salary from Employee order by Salary DESC limit N-1,1    <--Does not work

* From MySQL document: (Limit does not calcualte expression)
The LIMIT clause can be used to constrain the number of rows returned by the SELECT statement. 
LIMIT takes one or two numeric arguments, which must both be nonnegative integer constants (except when using prepared statements).
